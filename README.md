<h1>Testing Grounds</h1>
<p>A place for javascript and jquery learning and experimentation</p>

<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>This site is a palce for me to keep my javascript and jquery skills fresh. I'll be adding fancy plugins, techniques, and basically over=using javascript to the extreme here. My goal is to stay fresh with my js skills while I search for a full-time job, and also to provide a palce for me to try new things with little consequence of dealines, or "breaking" my code.</p>
